    "Why do these curves look different than the normal linear supply and demand curves in the textbook? It's because in the textbook we've made a vastly simplifying assumptions that supply and demand curves are linear in nature. This would imply that, no matter at what price, a price decrease by \\\\$1 would change the amount supplied or demanded by the same amount. \n",
    "\n",
    "Is this intuitively true? Probably not. For example, a \\\\$1 decrease from \\\\$100 is trivial compared to a \\\\$1 decrease from an original price of \\\\$2. As humans, we think about changes as proportions, and this fact should be reflected in the supply and demand curves. What this implies is that these curves should be exponential in nature: at higher prices, a larger change in price will yield the same change quantity as compared to that in lower prices. \n",

    "Your curves above should look somewhat exponential, which aligns with this intuition!\n",
